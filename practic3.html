        The definite article is sometimes also used with proper names, which are already specified by definition <br>
        (there is just one of them). For<span style="border: 2px solid black; display: block; width: 200px;"> example</span>: the Amazon, the Hebrides. In these cases, the definite article may<br>
         be considered superfluous. Its presence can be accounted for by the assumption that they are shorthand for a<br>
